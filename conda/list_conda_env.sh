#!/bin/bash


## This bash script appears to be using the shebang `#!/bin/bash` to 
 ## indicate that it is written to be executed using the Bash shell. The 
 ## script contains a single command:
 ## 
 ## ```
 ## conda info -e
 ## ```
 ## 
 ## This command is likely calling the `conda` tool, which is a package 
 ## manager used primarily with Anaconda to create and manage virtual 
 ## environments in Python. The `-e` option is used to list the existing 
 ## conda environments and their associated information.
 ## 
 ## Overall, this script is likely intended to display a list of all 
 ## conda environments configured on the system.
