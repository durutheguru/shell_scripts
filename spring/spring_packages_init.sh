#! /bin/bash


## This bash script creates six new directories in the current working 
 ## directory. These directories are named "controller", "service", 
 ## "repository", "dto", "entity", and "util". The script uses the 
 ## "mkdir" command to create each directory. So, when you run this 
 ## script, it will create these six directories for you to organize your 
 ## files in a structured manner.

mkdir controller
mkdir service
mkdir repository
mkdir dto
mkdir entity
mkdir util
