#!/bin/bash


## This Bash script uses the `cat` command to display the contents of 
 ## the file `~/.cron.log`. The `~` symbol refers to the user's home 
 ## directory. Therefore, when the script is executed, it will output the 
 ## contents of the `~/.cron.log` file onto the terminal.

cat ~/.cron.log
