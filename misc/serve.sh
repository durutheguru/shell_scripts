#!/bin/bash


## This bash script appears to be invoking a java web server program 
 ## called "jwebserver". Here's a breakdown of the script:
 ## 
 ## 1. The script uses the shebang `#!/bin/bash` to indicate that it 
 ## should be run using Bash.
 ## 
 ## 2. It sources a file called "java_v.sh" with the argument "19". This 
 ## file likely sets up some environment variables related to Java 
 ## version 19.
 ## 
 ## 3. The script checks if there is at least one command line argument 
 ## passed to the script using `$# -ge 1`.
 ## 
 ## 4. If there is at least one command line argument, it executes the 
 ## "jwebserver" program with the port number provided as the first 
 ## argument using `-p ${1}`.
 ## 
 ## 5. If there are no command line arguments, it simply runs the 
 ## "jwebserver" program without specifying a port number.
 ## 
 ## In summary, this script starts the "jwebserver" program, which will 
 ## run a Java web server. If a port number is provided as a command line 
 ## argument, it will use that port number; otherwise, it will run the 
 ## server with its default settings.
