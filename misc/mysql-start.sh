#! /bin/bash


## This bash script uses the '#!/bin/bash' shebang to specify that it 
 ## should be run using the Bash shell. The script then uses the 'brew 
 ## services start mysql' command to start the MySQL service using the 
 ## Homebrew package manager on a macOS system. This command instructs 
 ## Homebrew to start the MySQL service, allowing it to run in the 
 ## background.

brew services start mysql
