#! /bin/bash


## This bash script is using the `ipconfig` command with the `getifaddr 
 ## en0` argument. 
 ## 
 ## The `ipconfig` command is typically used on Unix-like systems (such 
 ## as macOS) to retrieve network configuration information. In this 
 ## case, the script is specifically requesting the IP address of the 
 ## network interface `en0`.
 ## 
 ## Therefore, when this script is executed, it will output the IP 
 ## address associated with the `en0` network interface on the system. 
 ## This can be useful for obtaining the local IP address of the machine 
 ## for networking or troubleshooting purposes.

ipconfig getifaddr en0
