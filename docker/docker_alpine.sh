#!/bin/bash


## This bash script is a simple one-liner that uses the `docker run` 
 ## command to run an instance of the Alpine Linux Docker container in 
 ## interactive mode. The `-it` flags are used to allocate a pseudo TTY 
 ## and keep STDIN open even if not attached. The command `/bin/sh` is 
 ## specified to start a shell session within the Alpine container. In 
 ## summary, this script launches a shell session inside an Alpine Linux 
 ## Docker container in interactive mode.

docker run -it alpine /bin/sh
