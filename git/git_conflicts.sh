#! /bin/bash


## This bash script appears to be a simple script using a Git command. 
 ## Here is a breakdown of what it does:
 ## 
 ## 1. `#!/bin/bash`: This is the shebang line that specifies the 
 ## interpreter to use to run the script, which is bash in this case.
 ## 
 ## 2. `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`: This line executes a Git 
 ## command with the following options:
 ## - `git diff`: This Git command is used to show changes between 
 ## commits, commit and working tree, etc.
 ## - `--name-only`: This option tells Git to only show the names of 
 ## the changed files, not the actual content changes.
 ## - `--diff-filter=U`: This option filters the files to display 
 ## based on the type of change. In this case, it filters only files with 
 ## conflicts, denoted by the `U` (unmerged conflict) status.
 ## 
 ## In summary, this script will list the names of files in the 
 ## repository that have conflicts or are in an unmerged state.

git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
